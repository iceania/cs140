/* returns the key to the frame that is now available, use the entry
   to install this page into the pagedir of the evicting thread that
   is asking for memory.   

   
   MEMORY - If we try to evict a page, it's medium should say that it is
   in memory or it does not make sense that we are evicting it.

   SWAP - If we evict something in memory and it is dirty and not a mmaped
   file we put it on swap, swap_allocate takes care of the rest.

   STACK - If we evict a stack page that's clean, we can just get a new
   page from thin air.  If we evict a dirty stack page, we write it to swap.

   EXECUTABLE - cannot write to executable, if we evict this we do nothing.
   MMAP - If we evict an mmapped page we write it back to the file system.
